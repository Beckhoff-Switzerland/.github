# CHALET

Repositories added to the Beckhoff-Switzerland organization with the prefix "CHALET_*" all belong to the same project. **CHALET** is an acronym for **C**ustom **H**ardware **A**bstraction **L**ayer as **E**xample or **T**raining. The intention is to close the gap between our product-oriented trainings and a pragmatic implementation of the driver interface in the PLC to start a project with.

The following components are on the current roadmap:

* [X] Base (identifiers, lists, asynchronous results)
* [X] NC (generic drive axis implementation)
* [X] XTS (station-oriented design approach)
* [X] XPlanar (station-oriented design approach)
* [ ] Vision (synchronized camera and illumination)

Each component will consist of a static class implementation (source project of the library) and a sample implementation that is indicated with the suffix ("*_Example").

The sources of this project are published under the 0BSD-license. They are not a Beckhoff product, so they will not be supported through the Beckhoff support hotline. Issues can be posted via GitHub. There is no guarantee or timeframe for any bugfixes or feature requests.

Take a look, understand the concept, get a head start and implement your custom solution.
